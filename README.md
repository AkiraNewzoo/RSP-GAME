Rock-Scissors-Paper game. Design and development is my first dev-work.
____________________________________________________________

Rules of the game
The game takes place in three steps and three iterations.
The player's side is blue.
The starting number of points is 1000.
____________________________________________________________

1) The player selects one of the pieces;
2) Selects the bet amount that the computer supports.
3) presses the Battle button!

At this time, the computer generates a random figure and compares it with the player's figure. The game lasts until 3 wins.
If a player wins 3 times, he takes the bank, the victories are reset and the cycle starts again.
If you lose 3 times, the bank burns. When a player's score is reset, the game is over.
